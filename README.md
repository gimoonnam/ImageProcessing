# Basic techniques on image processing 
##  1. Explored 4 types of image blurring methods
      1. Average 
      2. Median 
      3. Gaussian 
      4. Bilateral filter 

## 2. Implemented image blending using image pyramid methods
      - Gaussian Pyramid
      - Laplacian Pyramid


# mergeMertens using openCV built-in functons 
This notebook implements exposure fusion, which was introduced by Merten et al. This implementation was done based on openCV's instruction, which is well guided. 


This picture shows the result of my implemention on exposure fusion.
