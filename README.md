# Basic techniques on image processing 
##  1. Explored 4 types of image blurring methods
      1. Average 
      2. Median 
      3. Gaussian 
      4. Bilateral filter 

## 2. Implemented image blending using image pyramid methods
      - Gaussian Pyramid
      - Laplacian Pyramid


# <span style="color:blue"> Exposure fusion  </span> 

## 1. Multiresolution blending using OpenCV in Python 

This notebook implements exposure fusion, which was introduced by Merten et al. 

This picture shows the result of my implemention on exposure fusion.

## 2. High Dynamic Range radiance image fusion 

Coming soon...
