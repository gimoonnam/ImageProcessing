# Basic techniques on image processing 
##  1. Explored 4 types of image blurring methods
      1. Average 
      2. Median 
      3. Gaussian 
      4. Bilateral filter 

## 2. Implemented image blending using image pyramid methods
      - Gaussian Pyramid
      - Laplacian Pyramid


# mergeMertens using openCV built-in functons 
This notebook implements exposure fusion, which was introduced by Merten et al. This implementation was done based on openCV's instruction, which is well guided. 

There are serveral steps in the Merten's paper, but they are just embedded in the openCV functions. So I will go over each step in the following post.
